msgid "OpenDroneMap is FOSS software.  Free and open source (FOSS) projects are interesting from the inside and outside: from the outside, successful ones feel like they should be able to do anything, and it’s hard to know what a reasonable request is. From the inside of a project, they can feel very resource constrained: largely by time, money, and opportunity overload."

msgid "A feature request can be submitted as issues on the applicable Github repository (e.g., `WebODM <https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/WebODM/issues>`_ or `ODM <https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/ODM/issues>`_ or similar) or more simply as a discussion topic on `the community forum <https://community.opendronemap.org/>`_. Try to start by searching these sources to see if someone else has already brought it up.  Sometimes a feature is already in the works, or has at least been discussed."
