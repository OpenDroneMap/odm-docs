"Accuracy can be defined as the degree or closeness to which the information "
"on a map matches the values in the real world. Therefore, when we refer to "
"accuracy, we are talking about quality of data and about number of errors "
"contained in a certain dataset (Pascual 2011)."

" 1 to 3 times the average GSD for the dataset. And as for the absolute "
"accuracy, one must consider that it is dependent of the GPS unit mounted in "

"range of 2 to 6 meters and the vertical accuracy between 3 to 4 times the "
"horizontal accuracy."
